    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <h2>Information Collection and Use:</h2>
    <p>
      During the account creation process, our application may request access to
      your device's camera or photo library to allow you to upload a user image.
      This user image will be associated with your account and may be visible to
      other users within the application. When you choose to create an account
      using your Google credentials, our application may collect and securely
      store certain information provided by Google, such as your name, email
      address, and profile picture. This information is used for authentication
      purposes and to enhance your user experience within our application.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Storage and Security:</h2>
    <p>
      The user image you provide during account creation will be securely stored
      on our servers. We implement reasonable security measures to protect this
      data from unauthorized access, loss, or misuse. However, please note that
      no method of data transmission or storage is completely secure, and we
      cannot guarantee absolute data security. The Google account information
      collected during account creation is securely stored and associated with
      your user account. We employ industry-standard practices to protect this
      information from unauthorized access or disclosure.
    </p>

    <h2>Use of Information:</h2>
    <p>
      The user image you upload during account creation is used to personalize
      your account and enhance your experience within the application. It may be
      displayed to other users in appropriate sections of the application as per
      the functionality provided. The Google account information collected is
      used for authentication purposes and to provide a seamless account
      creation process. We may also use this information to personalize your
      experience within the application and communicate with you regarding
      updates, new features, or important notifications.
    </p>

    <h2>Third-Party Access:</h2>
    <p>
      We do not sell, trade, or transfer your personal information, including
      user images and Google account information, to third parties without your
      consent, except as required by law or as necessary to provide and improve
      our services. Our application may utilize third-party service providers or
      APIs to facilitate specific functionalities, such as Google sign-in. These
      providers may have their own privacy policies governing the collection,
      use, and disclosure of information. We encourage you to review their
      privacy policies before using their services.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Retention:</h2>
    <p>
      We retain your user account information, including user images and Google
      account information, for as long as your account remains active or as
      required by applicable laws. If you choose to delete your account, we will
      securely remove your personal information from our active databases.
      However, please note that some residual information may remain in our
      backups or archives for a reasonable period.
    </p>

    <h2>Updates to Privacy Policy:</h2>
    <p>
      We reserve the right to update or modify this Privacy Policy at any time.
      Any changes will be effective immediately upon posting the revised policy
      within the application. We will notify you of significant changes through
      prominent notices within the application or by other means of
      communication.
